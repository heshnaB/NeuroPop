NeuroPop – How to Run the Project (Local Demo)
1. Install Node.js (version 18 or higher).
Download from https://nodejs.org
 After installing, verify by running:
node -v

2. Download the project.
Option A (simplest):

   * Go to https://github.com/heshnaB/NeuroPop

   * Click “Code” → “Download ZIP”

   * Extract the ZIP file

   * Open a terminal inside the extracted folder

      3. Option B (using Git):
git clone https://github.com/heshnaB/NeuroPop.git
cd NeuroPop/date-duel-arena-main

      4. Install frontend dependencies.
From inside the date-duel-arena-main folder:
npm install

      5. Start the backend server (required for WebRTC).
Open a new terminal window and run:
cd server
npm install
node index.js
Keep this terminal running.

      6. Start the frontend.
In the main project folder (date-duel-arena-main):
npm run dev

      7. Open the local URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

      8. Allow camera and microphone permissions when prompted.

      9. To test the video connection, open the app in two browser windows (or one normal window and one incognito window). Each window acts as a separate participant.

That’s it. The demo runs fully locally with no additional configuration required.
