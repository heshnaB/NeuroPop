# 🌹 Roses are RED (FLAGS)

# Inspiration
Dating apps today are private, repetitive, and often unsafe. Red flags usually go unnoticed until it’s too late, and friends only hear the story afterward.
Since it’s Valentine’s Day, we wanted to build something fun, silly, chaotic, and completely unserious—a playful twist on dating instead of another serious matchmaking platform.
Before the time of competition, we thought:
What if dating was a live gladiator arena, where AI judges your date, friends spectate, and red flags get exposed in real time?
And so Roses are RED (FLAGS) was born!

# What it does
Roses are RED (FLAGS) pairs two strangers for a 3-minute live video date in a themed dating arena.
While they talk, an AI Referee analyzes the conversation for red flags, cringe moments, and funny commentary, shown live on screen.
Friends can join as private spectators, send embarrassing questions, trigger truth-or-dare challenges, and watch the date unfold.
 At the end of the timer, both users decide whether to continue or abort the date.

# Challenges we ran into
This was our first time building real-time video chat, AI live analysis, and spectator multiplayer features.
Major challenges included syncing real-time matchmaking, handling spectators without leaking private data, and designing sabotage tools that were fun but not harmful.
Integrating AI commentary live without disrupting video streaming was also technically challenging and required edge functions and streaming updates.
